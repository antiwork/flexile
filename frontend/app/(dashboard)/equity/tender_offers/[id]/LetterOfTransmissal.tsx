      outstanding and vested as of the Record Date or that are issued upon exercise of the Expiring Vested Options, the
      "<b>Eligible Securities</b>"), in each case that, as of the Record Date, are held by Eligible Securityholders, for
      a cash purchase price no less than $0.00 per Eligible Security (the "<b>Offer Price</b>"), upon the terms and
      subject to the conditions in the Offer to Purchase and in this Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the
      Offer to Purchase, each with all exhibits thereto and as may be amended or supplemented from time to time,
      collectively constitute the "<b>Offer</b>"). Capitalized terms that are used in this Letter of Transmittal but not
      defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Offer to Purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      To participate in the Offer, you must (A) hold Eligible Securities as of the Record Date and through the
      Settlement Date and (B) reside in an Offer Jurisdiction (as defined below) (a person who meets all such criteria,
      an "<b>Eligible Securityholder</b>"). "<b>Offer Jurisdiction</b>" means each of Australia, Austria, Brazil,
      Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, India, Indonesia, Portugal, Romania, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, United
      Kingdom, United States and Uruguay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Offer is being made to Eligible Securityholders only and is not intended to be distributed in any jurisdiction
      other than an Offer Jurisdiction. Holders of the Company's securities who reside in any jurisdiction other than an
      Offer Jurisdiction are not eligible to participate in the Offer, and any attempt to tender the Company's
      securities in the Offer by any such holders in any such jurisdiction other than an Offer Jurisdiction will be null
      and void.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Company has made its online platform Flexile (the "<b>Platform</b>") available to the Eligible Securityholders
      for submissions of information related to the Offer. By electronically signing and submitting this Letter of
      Transmittal, together with completing a "Sell Order" on the Platform, the undersigned hereby (i) contingent upon
      closing of the Offer, surrenders to the Company the electronic certificate(s) representing the undersigned's
      Eligible Securities that the undersigned desires to tender, and that the Company elects to purchase from the
      Eligible Securityholder pursuant to the offer, electronically held by the Company's capitalization records
      management system and authorizes such electronic certificates to be electronically cancelled in connection with
      the transfer of any Eligible Securities to the Company, and/or (ii) if tendering Vested Options for cancellation
      on the Platform, contingent upon closing of the Offer, agrees that the Option Cancellation Notice, attached as
      <b>Exhibit B</b> hereto (the "<b>Option Cancellation Notice</b>") submitted to the Company shall become effective
      with respect to the undersigned's Vested Options that the undersigned desires to cancel, and that the Company
      elects to purchase pursuant to the Offer, for the cash payment described in the Offer. The undersigned desires to
      tender to the Company the Eligible Securities set forth below in exchange for the Offer Price, less (i) all
      applicable withholding taxes and transfer taxes and (ii) in the case of Vested Options that are cancelled, the
      aggregate exercise price of the underlying Vested Options, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
      Offer to Purchase. Such tender of Eligible Securities shall be irrevocable by the undersigned and the Company as
      of the Expiration Date.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you elect to tender your Vested Options in the Offer, and the Company elects to cancel such Vested Options
      pursuant to the Offer, (1) your submission of this Letter of Transmittal, including the applicable annexes,
      schedules and exhibits, will cancel and terminate the applicable Vested Options, as set forth in the Option
      Cancellation Notice, and the Company will cancel such Vested Options in accordance with the Offer to Purchase and
      (2) your Vested Options will be cancelled and terminated effective on the Settlement Date, and conditioned on the
      closing of the Offer, in exchange for a cash payment, as described in the Offer to Purchase, equal to the Offer
      Price, less (i) all applicable withholding taxes and transfer taxes and (ii) the aggregate exercise price of the
      Vested Options. Any such cancellation of any Vested Option will be contingent on the Company's purchase or
      cancellation of Eligible Securities in the Offer, so that if any condition to the Company's purchase or
      cancellation is not satisfied or waived, and the Company does not complete the purchase or cancellation of the
      Eligible Securities, the Company will not recognize the cancellation of your Vested Options, and your Vested
      Options will remain outstanding. For the avoidance of doubt, the Vested Options tendered for cancellation in
      connection with the Offer shall not be exercised, and no shares of Common Stock shall be issued with respect to
      such Vested Options, and instead such Vested Options will be cancelled for the cash consideration as set forth in
      this Letter of Transmittal, and subject to the terms of each of this Letter of Transmittal (and the exhibits
      thereto) and the Offer to Purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any of your Vested Options expire on or prior to the Settlement Date (the "<b>Expiring Vested Options</b>"),
      and you wish to tender such Expiring Vested Options, you must exercise such Expiring Vested Options through a cash
      exercise prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Expiration Date and (ii) the expiration date of such Expiring
      Vested Options. Such cash exercise cannot be contingent upon the closing of the Offer and the Company will not
      extend the expiration date of any option. If you have questions about exercising through a cash exercise, please
      contact the Company at{" "}
      <a className={linkClasses} href="mailto:support@flexile.com">
        support@flexile.com
      </a>{" "}
      for additional information. No other holders of Vested Options wishing to participate in the Offer shall be
      permitted to exercise such Vested Options from the Offer Date through the Expiration Date.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, if your Vested Options are Incentive Stock Options ("<b>ISOs</b>"), if the Offer remains outstanding
      for longer than 29 calendar days, your Vested Options may cease to be treated as ISOs. Therefore, if you hold ISOs
      and do not affirmatively reject the Offer on or prior to the date that is 29 calendar days after the Offer
      commences, your ISOs will be disqualified and thereafter treated as nonqualified stock options ("<b>NSOs</b>").
    </p>
    <p>
      You should consult with your legal, financial or tax advisor before participating in the Offer or exercising
      Expiring Vested Options.

      <b>OFFERED SECURITIES HELD BY YOU</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Please confirm that the "Tender Offer Details" page on the Platform correctly reflects the Eligible Securities
      that you wish to sell or tender to the Company in the Offer (the "<b>Offered Securities</b>"), including the
      allocation, if any, between vested shares of Common Stock, Eligible Preferred Stock and, if applicable, Vested
      Options. The Company reserves the right to increase the maximum aggregate purchase price up to $1,760,000 to
      purchase all Eligible Securities in its sole and absolute discretion. If the aggregate number of Offered
      Securities tendered in the Offer exceeds that number of shares at a price per share that would exceed $1,000,000,
      or, if the Company elects to increase the maximum aggregate purchase price up to $1,760,000 (an "
      <b>Oversubscription</b>"), the number of Eligible Securities that you will be permitted to tender will be reduced
      on a pro rata basis based upon the number of Eligible Securities that you have offered for sale and/or
      cancellation (as applicable) and the number of Eligible Securities that other holders of Eligible Securities have
      offered for sale and/or cancellation (as applicable).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Eligible Securityholder who intends to sell or tender Eligible Securities in the Offer will need to complete
      and submit a separate Letter of Transmittal. This means that if Eligible Securities are held by family members,
      trusts or other persons or entities related to or affiliated with you, each such other person or entity must
      complete, submit and electronically sign a separate Letter of Transmittal. If you have any questions on
      completing, submitting and electronically signing a separate Letter of Transmittal, please contact the Company at{" "}

      Letter of Transmittal and in the accompanying Offer to Purchase. However, please note that your proceeds from the

      applicable withholding taxes and transfer taxes and (ii) in the case of Vested Options that are tendered for
      cancellation, the aggregate exercise price of the Vested Options.
    </p>
    <p>

      are responsible for ensuring that the account indicated will accept a wire transfer in U.S. Dollars, and you will
      be responsible for any fees imposed by your banking institution (or any intermediate institution through which the

      hold the Remaining Securities, and the Remaining Securities will not be impacted by the Offer. The Company will
      issue a new electronic stock certificate(s) for you for any Remaining Securities.
    </p>
    <p>

      SERVICE ("<b>IRS</b>") AND OTHER APPLICABLE TAX AUTHORITIES, WHICH CONSEQUENCES MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE
      INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL OR THE OFFER TO PURCHASE OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT MADE AVAILABLE
      TO YOU AS PART OF THE OFFER. THE COMPANY DISCLAIMS ANY OBLIGATION TO ADVISE ON NON-U.S. JURISDICTION LAW. YOU ARE

      PARTICIPATING IN THE OFFER.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tax consequences of participating in the Offer are based on complex laws, which may be subject to varying
      interpretations and the application of which may depend, in large part, on the surrounding facts and

      described in this Letter of Transmittal, the Offer to Purchase or any other document made available to you as part
      of the Offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      By electronically signing this Letter of Transmittal, you acknowledge that: (i) the Company is not guaranteeing
      any particular tax treatment of the sale or cancellation of your Offered Securities if you choose to participate
      in the Offer, (ii) the actual tax treatment of your participation in the Offer may differ from the description set
      forth in the Offer to Purchase and this Letter of Transmittal, (iii) you may have adverse tax consequences if you

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Under United States federal income tax law, Eligible Securityholders who are "U.S. persons" (as defined in the
      instructions to the IRS Form W-9 attached as <b>Exhibit D-1</b>) may be subject to backup withholding in an amount
      currently equal to 24% of the gross proceeds received for the Offered Securities in connection with the Offer to
      Purchase. To avoid such backup withholding, each Eligible Securityholder participating in the Offer who is a U.S.
      person must (i) furnish a correct taxpayer identification number and certify under penalties of perjury that such
      holder is not subject to backup withholding by completing an IRS Form W-9 included with this Letter of Transmittal
      (attached as <b>Exhibit D-1</b>) or as provided on the Platform, or (ii) otherwise establish to the satisfaction
      of the Company an exemption from backup withholding.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for an Eligible Securityholder who is not a U.S. person to avoid being subject to backup withholding,
      such Eligible Securityholder must submit a properly completed and appropriate IRS Form W-8, as well as any
      required supporting information. An IRS Form W-8BEN is included with this Letter of Transmittal and attached as
      <b>Exhibit D-2</b> and an IRS Form W-8BEN-E is included with this Letter of Transmittal and attached as
      <b>Exhibit D-3</b>. Additional IRS Forms W-8, such as IRS Form W-8IMY and IRS Form W-8ECI, are available at{" "}
      <a className={linkClasses} href="http://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        www.irs.gov
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      An Eligible Securityholder who fails to provide a properly completed and signed IRS Form W-9 or a properly
      completed and signed applicable IRS Form W-8, as appropriate, may be subject to backup withholding under U.S. tax
      laws on the purchase price paid for Eligible Securities pursuant to the Offer and may also be subject to a penalty
      imposed by the IRS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Generally, any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
      described above can be refunded or credited against an Eligible Securityholder's U.S. federal income tax liability
      provided that such Eligible Securityholder timely furnishes the requisite information to the IRS. Each Eligible
      Securityholder should consult their own tax advisors regarding application of backup withholding in their
      particular circumstances and the availability of, and procedure for obtaining, an exemption from backup
      withholding under current Treasury regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, an Eligible Securityholder who is not a U.S. person should be aware that if the transactions
      described in the Offer to Purchase result in the amounts payable to you being treated as a dividend for U.S.
      federal income tax purposes, the Company and its agents will withhold all applicable taxes that may apply. In
      general, withholding taxes on U.S. source dividends are imposed at a 30% rate, unless reduced pursuant to an
      applicable tax treaty. If the Company fails to withhold such tax, an Eligible Securityholder who is not a U.S.
      person would be directly liable for such taxes to the IRS. Eligible Securityholders who are not U.S. persons
      should consult their tax advisors for further guidance regarding the potential application of, and possible
      exemptions from, such withholding. The Company disclaims any obligation to advise on non-US jurisdiction law and
      advises potential participants to consult their own tax advisors.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT: (A) ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS NOT INTENDED TO
      CONSTITUTE TAX ADVICE WITH RESPECT TO ANY TAXPAYER'S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND (B) THE TAXPAYER SHOULD SEEK
      ADVICE BASED ON THE TAXPAYER'S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CANCELLATION OF STOCK OPTIONS</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to tender Vested Options, such Vested Options will be cancelled and terminated effective on the
      Settlement Date and conditioned on the closing of the Offer, in exchange for a cash payment equal to the Offer
      Price, less (i) all applicable withholding taxes and transfer taxes and (ii) the aggregate exercise price of the
      Vested Options. To ease the administrative burden of executing multiple cancellation notices for each award of
      Vested Options that you desire to tender, the Company has provided a single Option Cancellation Notice, which is
      attached to this Letter of Transmittal as
      <b>Exhibit B</b>. Any cancellation of Vested Options in connection with this Offer will be contingent upon the
      closing of the Offer and will be effective as of the Settlement Date. Following the tender, cancellation and
      termination of any Vested Options in the Offer, you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such
      Vested Options, other than the right to receive the cash payment described herein. For the avoidance of doubt, the
      Vested Options tendered for cancellation in connection with the Offer shall not be exercised, and no shares of
      Common Stock shall be issued with respect to such Vested Options, and instead such Vested Options will be
      cancelled for the cash consideration as set forth in, and subject to, the terms of this Letter of Transmittal (and
      the exhibits thereto) and the Offer to Purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any of your Vested Options expire on or prior to the Settlement Date (the "<b>Expiring Vested Options</b>"),
      and you wish to tender such Expiring Vested Options, you must exercise such Expiring Vested Options through a cash
      exercise prior to the earlier of (i) the Expiration Date and (ii) the expiration date of such Expiring Vested
      Options. Such cash exercise cannot be contingent upon the closing of the Offer and the Company will not extend the
      expiration date of any option. If you have questions about exercising through a cash exercise, please contact the
      Company at{" "}

        Transmittal, as completed by the undersigned, and (d) has independently and without reliance upon the Company,
        its management or board of directors or any of its members, managers, equity holders or any of their respective
        affiliates, or any of the Company's agents or representatives, and based on such information and the advice of
        such advisors as the undersigned has deemed appropriate to consult, made his, her, or its own analysis and
        decision to tender the Offered Securities pursuant to the Offer. The undersigned acknowledges that none of the
        Company, its management or board of directors or any of the Company's agents or representatives, is acting as a
        fiduciary or financial or investment or tax advisor to the undersigned, or has provided the undersigned with any
        advice, opinion, or recommendation regarding whether to tender Common Stock, Eligible Preferred Stock or Vested
        Options for cancellation pursuant to the Offer or how many Eligible Securities to tender. In making the decision
        to participate in the Offer, the only information from the Company upon which the undersigned has relied is the
        information set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Letter of Transmittal, the exhibits to each, and the Company
        Information provided on the Platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        The undersigned acknowledges that certain Eligible Securityholders may currently have information regarding the
        Company, including but not limited to its business, its financial condition, its prospects, and the value of
        Common Stock and Eligible Preferred Stock, that is not known to the undersigned and that may affect the
        undersigned's assessment of the value of the undersigned's Offered Securities and the prudence of tendering the
        Offered Securities pursuant to the Offer (the "<b>Excluded Information</b>"). The undersigned acknowledges and
        agrees that the undersigned has determined to tender the Offered Securities notwithstanding his, her, or its
        lack of knowledge of the Excluded Information.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no action, suit, proceeding, judgment, claim or investigation pending, or to the knowledge of the
        undersigned, threatened against the undersigned which could reasonably be expected in any manner to challenge or
        seek to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay any of the transactions contemplated by the Offer to Purchase
        or this Letter of Transmittal.
      </li>
      <li>
        The undersigned is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 proceeding under U.S. law or similar case
        or involved in any insolvency proceeding or reorganization.
      </li>
      <li>
        The undersigned is selling the shares for the undersigned's own account only and not with a view to, or for sale
        in connection with, a distribution of the shares within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
        and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
      </li>
      <li>
        The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that if his or her stock options qualify as incentive stock options ("
        <b>ISOs</b>"), if the Offer remains outstanding for longer than 29 calendar days, the undersigned's stock
        options may cease to be treated as ISOs.
      </li>
      <li>
        The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that if his or her Eligible Securities are shares of Common Stock that
        have been acquired in connection with the exercise of an ISO, the tender of such shares of Common Stock to the
        Company in connection with the Offer may constitute what is known as a "disqualifying disposition" of the ISOs
        under certain tax rules. A "disqualifying disposition" occurs if the ISO Shares are sold or tendered before
        certain holding periods are met. If a "disqualifying disposition" has occurred, the tender of the ISOs will not
        be subject to the "ISO" tax treatment that may otherwise have applied if such stock options had been exercised
        in a manner qualifying for such tax treatment. Further, the undersigned acknowledges that if his or her Eligible
        Securities are Vested Options that otherwise qualify as ISOs, any cash payment received by the undersigned as a
        result of the tender and cancellation of such Vested Options in connection with the Offer shall also not qualify
        for "ISO" tax treatment that may have otherwise applied if such stock options had been exercised and the
        underlying shares of Common Stock had held for the applicable holding period prior to the sale of such shares.
      </li>
      <li>
        The undersigned has had an opportunity to review the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of
        the tender of the Offered Securities to the Company and the transactions contemplated by the Offer to Purchase
        and this Letter of Transmittal with his, her or its own tax advisors. The undersigned is not relying on any
        statements or representations of the Company or any of its members, managers, equity holders or any of its
        affiliates or any of its agents or representatives with respect to tax matters and understands that the tax
        consequences to the undersigned in connection with his or her participation in the Offer may differ from those
        described in the Offer to Purchase. The undersigned understands that the undersigned (and not the Company) shall
        be responsible for his or her own tax liability that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by
        the Offer to Purchase and this Letter of Transmittal. The undersigned understands that there are circumstances
        in which the Company will not withhold taxes in connection with the tender of Offered Securities and the
        undersigned is separately responsible for paying the applicable taxes. The undersigned further understands that
        the time frame in which these tax payments must be sent varies based on a number of factors and the undersigned
        should consult a tax advisor to determine whether payments would be required prior to when tax returns are
        otherwise filed. The undersigned agrees that the undersigned shall be solely responsible for the payment of and,
        so far as permitted by law, shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay or reimburse the Company and any of its
        members, managers, equity holders and any of its affiliates and its successors, assigns, directors, managers,
        agents, officers and employees (on an after-tax basis) from and against any and all taxes, penalties and
        interest, including withholding taxes (the "<b>Tax Obligations</b>"), that arise out of or are in connection
        with the Offer and the Company's purchase and the undersigned's tender of his, her or its Offered Securities,
        and all cost, expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, judgments,
        fines, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) including, without limitation,
        the defense costs in any suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in
        connection with the Tax Obligations.

      <b>STOCK CERTIFICATE CANCELLATION FORM</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Reference is hereby made to that certain Letter of Transmittal to which this Stock Certificate Cancellation Form
      is attached as <b>Exhibit A</b>. All terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
      the Letter of Transmittal. The term "<b>Eligible Securityholder</b>" refers to the person or entity executing the
      Letter of Transmittal to which this Stock Certificate Cancellation Form is attached.
    </p>
    <p>The Eligible Securityholder hereby declares, under penalty of perjury as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The Offered Securities to be sold by the Eligible Securityholder to the Company in connection with the Offer are
        set forth in the Platform along with the number of the electronic stock certificate(s) representing such Offered
        Securities (collectively, the "<b>Certificates</b>").
      </li>
      <li>
        The Eligible Securityholder is the lawful owner of the Offered Securities listed in the Platform, which shares
        were acquired by the Eligible Securityholder prior to the date hereof. The Eligible Securityholder has the
        absolute right to sell, assign, convey, transfer, and deliver such Offered Securities. The Eligible
        Securityholder has not pledged or sold such Offered Securities or any other shares represented by the
        Certificates, nor has the Eligible Securityholder made any other transfer thereof.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Eligible Securityholder understands and agrees that by signing electronically, the Certificates representing
        the Offered Securities (or portion of the Offered Securities) that the Company elects to repurchase from you
        will be null and void upon the effectiveness of the sale of the Offered Securities to the Company following the
        expiration of the Offer.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the Eligible Securityholder holds or discovers the Certificates after the completion of the Offer, the
        undersigned agrees to promptly return the Certificates to the Company marked "cancelled."
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Exhibit B</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>OPTION CANCELLATION NOTICE</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Reference is hereby made to that certain Letter of Transmittal to which this Option Cancellation Notice is
      attached as <b>Exhibit B</b>. All terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
      the Letter of Transmittal. The term "<b>Optionee</b>" refers to the person or entity executing the Letter of
      Transmittal to which this Option Cancellation Notice is attached.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Cancellation of Option</b>. Effective as of 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the Expiration Date, and contingent
        upon the closing of the Offer on the Settlement Date, Optionee hereby elects to cancel and terminate each of the
        Vested Options (each, an "<b>Option</b>") set forth on the Platform under the "Sell Order" page or such lesser
        number of Vested Options the Company elects to repurchase from you pursuant to the Offer (the "
        <b>Tendered Vested Option Shares</b>"), in consideration for a cash payment equal to the Offer Price multiplied
        by the number of Tendered Vested Option Shares less (i) all applicable withholding taxes and transfer taxes, and
        (ii) the aggregate exercise price of the underlying Options so tendered for cancellation and termination.
      </li>
      <p>
        Optionee understands and agrees that this cancellation and termination is contingent upon and will be deemed
        effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Offer, as set forth in further detail in the accompanying
        Offer to Purchase. If the Offer is ultimately not consummated, then such cancellation and termination of the
        Option will not be effective. Optionee may only tender and cancel his or her options using this Option
        Cancellation Notice as of the Offer Date until 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the Expiration Date.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Consideration for Cancellation</b>. Optionee hereby acknowledges and agrees that, for each Option that
        Optionee tenders for cancellation and termination in connection with the Offer, the Company will pay to Optionee
        a cash payment equal to the Offer Price less (i) all applicable withholding taxes and transfer taxes, and (ii)
        the aggregate exercise price of the underlying Options so tendered for cancellation and termination. Optionee
        hereby acknowledges and agrees that, in lieu of payment by the Company for Optionee's cancelled Options, the
        Company may instead choose to make such payment(s) through its normal payroll practices (or those of your
        employing entity).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Tax Withholding</b>. Optionee hereby acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent the Company or Optionee's
        employing entity has tax withholding obligations with respect to an Option the Company, or the Company itself,
        will reduce the total amounts payable to such Optionee as a result of participating in the Offer by the
        applicable withholding obligations and will remit such amounts to the Company, or in the case of the Company,
        shall keep such amounts, to be remitted to the appropriate tax authorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Representations of Optionee</b>. Optionee acknowledges that Optionee has received, read and understood the
        Offer to Purchase, this Letter of Transmittal, the Company's 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and the
        applicable Incentive Stock Option Agreement and/or Nonstatutory Stock Option Agreement, and this Option
        Cancellation Notice and agrees to abide by and be bound by their terms and conditions. Optionee represents to
        the Company that Optionee is aware of the Company's business affairs and financial condition and has acquired
        sufficient information about the Company and the Offer to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to tender
        the Option for cancellation and termination in the Offer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Tax Consultation</b>. Optionee understands that Optionee may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of
        Optionee's tender of the Option for cancellation and termination. Optionee represents that Optionee has
        consulted with any tax advisors Optionee deems advisable in connection with the tender of each Option for
        cancellation and termination and that Optionee is not relying on the Company or Optionee's employing entity for
        any tax advice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Flexile Platform</b>. In connection with the cancellation and termination of any Options that you properly
        tender in the Offer, and solely in order to complete the cancellation and termination of such Options through
        the Platform, the Company may denote on the Platform that a stock certificate has been issued for shares of
        Common Stock underlying the cancelled Options on a temporary basis. Immediately after such stock certificate is
        created, the Company shall cancel such stock certificate in connection with the cancellation and termination of
        such Options. Furthermore, no stock ownership rights will attach to any such stock certificate created by the
        Company in connection with the cancellation or termination of Options through the Platform as part of the Offer.
        Optionee understands, acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding this administrative process on the Platform,
        (i) Optionee is hereby agreeing to cancel each applicable Option tendered in the Offer, and (ii) each such
        Option tendered in the Offer shall at no point be exercised and no shares of Common Stock shall in fact be
        issued with respect to such Options, and each such Option shall instead by cancelled for the cash consideration
        as set forth in, and subject to, the terms of this Option Cancellation Notice, the Offer to Purchase, the Letter
        of Transmittal and the exhibits thereto. Optionee hereby agrees that he, she or it will not take any position in
        any tax filing or otherwise to the contrary with respect to any Options tendered in the Offer.
