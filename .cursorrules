- Always use the latest version of TypeScript, React, and Next.js
- Sentence case headers and buttons and stuff, not title case
- Always write ALL of the code
- Don't apologize for errors, fix them
- Newlines at end of files, always

- To add a feature:
  - Add page to `apps/next/app/**/page.tsx`
  - Add any components to `apps/next/components/**/*.tsx`
  - Add tRPC API routes to `apps/next/trpc/routes/**/index.ts` and then add those to `apps/next/trpc/server.ts`
  - Create API handlers using tRPC API routes that follow REST principles

- For writing end-to-end tests:
  - Use Playwright tests in `e2e/**/*.spec.ts`
  - If migrating from rspec, delete the rspec tests
  - Factories can be created using the rspec factories in `spec/factories` in the `/e2e/factories` folder
  - For any broken locators / assertions, you can use the playwright extension to record tests or pick locators

- For writing front-end code:
  - Do not use `React.FC`. Use the following syntax: `const Component = ({ prop1, prop2 }: { prop1: string; prop2: number }) => { ... }`

- Tech debt:
  - Add a `TODO (techdebt)` comment to document refactors that should be made in the future

- UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DO NOT ADD COMMENTS TO THE CODE
