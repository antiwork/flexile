  This amount will be deposited into your chosen payout method, minus any taxes (if applicable).
</p>
<p><strong>To avoid delays in your payment, make sure to review the following:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Your payout method is up to date</b><br>
    <% if @user.bank_account_for_dividends %>
      Your distribution will be paid to a bank account ending in ***<%= @user.bank_account_for_dividends.last_four_digits %>.
    <% end %>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>You're comfortable with your minimum payout threshold</b><br>
    <% if @user.minimum_dividend_payment_in_cents > 0 %>
      Currently, amounts below
      <%= cents_format(@user.minimum_dividend_payment_in_cents, no_cents_if_whole: false) %>
      will not be paid out and accumulate instead.
    <% else %>
      Because your distribution payout threshold is set to $0, you will receive all dividends.
    <% end %>
  </li>
  <% if @tax_amount_in_cents.positive? %>
    <li>
      <b>You're comfortable with your tax withholding amount</b><br>
      Update your tax info in order to update your tax withholding amount
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ol>
<p>
  Please update your account information within 10 days, after which we will process your distribution.
