<h1>
  Determine your equity % to become a stakeholder in <%= @company.name %>
</h1>
<p>
  <%= @company.name %>'s equity program lets you exchange a portion of your cash compensation for a stake in the
  company, which take the form as granted Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs).
</p>
<p>
  What are stock options?
  Stock options give you the chance to buy a set number of <%= @company.name %> shares at a fixed price known as the
  "exercise price." These options, once vested and exercised (purchased from the company), enable you to participate
  in potential liquidity events such as dividends and secondary offerings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How does <%= @company.name %> determine my stock options?</strong><br>
  You can exchange anywhere from 0% to <%= CompanyWorker::MAX_EQUITY_PERCENTAGE %>% of your rate.
  At the beginning of the year, you will be granted options for the full year, unvested. As your invoices get
  approved, your chosen percentage of the invoice total will be received as vested options that are then eligible for
  exercise.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>When can I exercise my options?</strong><br>
  You can exercise your options any time starting now to 10 years from now.
